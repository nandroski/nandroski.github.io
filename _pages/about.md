I am a pre-candidate PhD student at the [University of Michigan's](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/) Climate and Space Science department advised by Dr. Christiane Jablonowski. Currently, I am involved in testing and applying high resolution climate modeling to study atmospheric dynamics.

In 2024, I recieved my BS in Physics at [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://calpoly.edu) with minors in mathematics and astronomy. I conducted reserach in a variety of projects including nuclear fission, stellar evolution, and solar physics.

Academic Interests:
* High resolution climate model development
* Ideal simulation test cases as tools for comparison, understanding, and teaching.
* Data visualization and interaction as an effective tool for teaching others
