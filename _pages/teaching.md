One of my favorite things to do with physics is to take what I've learned from my courses and create a concise summary of what I found to be the most important ingredients. I primarily use <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> to write and share my notes due to the <a href="https://katex.org/docs/supported.html">KaTeX</a> support and easy link-sharing functionality. As I complete my PhD, my goal is to populate this page with these concise summaries of what I've learned in my courses past and present. In no way are these notes perfect, but I hope that they can provide a sensible perspective on core ideas in physics. If you find any glaring issues please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:nandrosk@umich.edu">nandrosk@umich.edu</a>. I also plan on making shorter posts on the blog for particularly interesting math and physics concepts.

# Mathematical Methods of Physics

These notes primarily focus on the similarities that can be drawn between the mathematics of vectors (linear algebra) with functions that lead to the ideas of functional analysis.  The idea that functions are vectors has powerful implications in the study of differential equations.
