      description:
        - Advised by Dr. Kristoff Paulson.
        - "Developed original code to extract, visualize, and analyze plasma and electromagnetic (EM) data from NASA\'s Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission in order to search for EM wave activity in the Sun\'s corona that may contribute to the high temperatures at the crux of the coronal heating problem."
        - "Produced a catalog of Sub-Alfvenic intervals in PSP data which indicates when the probe is within the corona and presented the list to the PSP's SWEAP instrument science team."
        - title: Cal Poly Senior Project.
          contents:
            - Continued work with Dr. Paulson until June 2024 culminating in a <a href='https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/physsp/234'>senior project report</a>.
            - The report provides a comprehensive overview of ion-cyclotron waves in the context of solar coronal heating.
