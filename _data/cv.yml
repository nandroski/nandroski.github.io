    - title: Solar Research Experience for Undergraduates
      institution: Center for Astrophysics Harvard and Smithsonian.
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Advised by Dr. Kristoff Paulson.
        - "Developed original code to extract, visualize, and analyze plasma and electromagnetic (EM) data from NASAs Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission in order to search for EM wave activity in the Suns corona that may contribute to the high temperatures at the crux of the coronal heating problem."
        - "Produced a catalog of Sub-Alfvenic intervals in PSP data which indicates when the probe is within the corona and presented the list to the PSPs SWEAP instrument science team."
        - title: Cal Poly Senior Project.
          contents:
            - Continued work with Dr. Paulson until June 2024 culminating in a <a href='https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/physsp/234'>senior project report</a>.
            - The report provides a comprehensive overview of ion-cyclotron waves in the context of solar coronal heating.

      description:
        - Advised by Dr. Elizabeth Jeffery.
        - Standardized photometry of the metal rich open cluster NGC 6253 and used a Bayesian Analysis software (BASE-9) to constrain the cluster age by fitting the main sequence turn off age.
        - Presented work as a poster at the 2024 Winter AAS meeting.

    - title: Frost Research Student
      institution: Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.
      year: 2022
      description:
        - Simulated unresolved binary star systems to analyze the effectiveness of a novel technique for measuring the age of individual main sequence stars through Bayesian analysis.
        - Developed a data framework in Jupyter Notebook with widgets that organized and streamlined the analysis of 100s of non-Gaussian posterior distributions.
        - Presented a <a href='https://aas241-aas.ipostersessions.com/?s=68-F7-D6-9E-51-76-EB-58-0E-CC-C3-ED-0D-7E-5D-86'>poster</a> presentation at the 2023 Winter AAS meeting.
